// Introducing @PreDestroy

closing the connection using destroy.

   @PreDestroy
    public void closeStudentConnection() throws SQLException {
        System.out.println("Closing connection");
        //used for cleanup 
        conn.close();
    }

@PreDestroy method will be called before the bean is removed from the container.

//Important:
Remember that the destroy method will be only called once your container object got destroyed/closed.

Why spring is not calling our custom destroy method?? 
What kind of application we're working??

When working with desktop app, we should manually close it.
When working with web app, framework will automatically close the container.

//
@PreDestroy
    public void destroy() throws SQLException {
        System.out.println("Destroying connection");
        closeStudentConnection();
    }

// destory container object
//closing the container object manually
        
context.close();

LICECYCLE:
1. CONTAINER STARTED.
2. BEAN INSTANTIATED
3. DEPENDECNY INJECTED
4. YOUR CUSTOM INIT()- @PostConstruct METHOD
5. BEAN IS READY TO USE
6. CONTAINER SHUTDOWN
7. YOUR CUSTOM DESTORY()- @PreDestroy METHOD
8. STOP
