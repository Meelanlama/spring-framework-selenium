--FOR Primitive type and String type autowiring is not possible.
As spring cannot think of the data we need to enter.
So use <property name="nameOfPerson" value= "Milan Tamang">

Autowiring is possible only for objects.

1. If both "byName" and "byType" fails than use @Qualifier after autowired.

@Autowired
@Qualifier("id_name") 


--- If the above annotation is written before the dependency then no need for setter method.
Example:

@Autowired
@Qualifier("humanHeart") 
    private Heart heart;

//

@Autowired doesn't need a setter to do the dependecny injection.

Doubt: Then how is it working? How is dependency injection done?

Simple:
@Autowired
@Qualifier("humanHeart") -> if match found for humanHeart in xml file then directly create object and inject that to the dependecy called heart.
    private Heart heart;

Example: Heart humanHeart = new Heart(); created via xml

if found by autowired then in class dependency:
Heart heart = humanHeart; //Injected that found obj in the dependency
